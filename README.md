## About Forge

Forge is a cutting-edge initiative aimed at developing a prototype that provides:
- **Declarative APIs**: Simplify image builds through intuitive and easy-to-use configurations.
- **Powerful Automation**: Streamline the image-building process across different infrastructures.
- **Cloud Integrations**: Connect with leading cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, Azure, and more.
  
At its core, Forge relies on **infrastructure providers** (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) and **provisioner providers** (e.g., Ansible) to build images efficiently. 

Our vision is to make Forge a **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)** project, enhancing its reach and adoption in the cloud-native ecosystem.
